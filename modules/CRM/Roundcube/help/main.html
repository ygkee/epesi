If you want to use your e-mail account while working with epesi, you can use our built-in Roundcube e-mail client. It allows you to write and send e-mails like any other client. On top of that there is an option to store your e-mails directly in epesi and attach it to all kinds of records. To learn more about Roundcube visit its <a target="_blank" href="http://roundcube.net">official site</a>.

While there choose "E-mail Accounts" button (on the picture). Here you can see the list of your e-mail accounts that have been added to epesi. If you're in this section for the first time, it will probably be empty.

	<li>
	<span style="font-weight:bold;">General info.</span> Fields in this section provide basic information about created account. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Epesi User</span> indicates who will this account will be attached to. For normal epesi users this field cannot be changed and it points on the current user. In <span style="font-weight:bold;">E-mail</span> you should enter e-mail address for the account you are adding. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Account Name</span> serves as an indicator for the user, which shall help in quick distinguishing between accounts.
	</li>
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Server specification.</span> Enter here the name of your e-mail pop/imap server, your login and password for this server (all three required) and specify the security level (either none, SSL or TLS).
	</li>
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Smtp server specification.</span> Specify the name of smtp server of your e-mail account. If login, password and security level are the same for both pop/imap and smtp protocol, you can leave the rest of the fields in this section empty. In other case, check "Smtp Auth" and enter data for smtp.
	</li>
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Default account.</span> Check this option if you want this account to be your main one. This means that it will be displayed as default in epesi Roundcube client and will be the default account for sending e-mails. You can have only one e-mail account set as default.
	</li>
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced options.</span> There are a few additional options available here. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Archive on sending</span> - if this option is checked, all your e-mails sent while using epesi Roundcube client will be automatically archived in epesi.<span style="font-weight:bold;">IMAP Root</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">IMAP Delimiter</span> shall be filled if you are using IMAP server that is configured in a way that requires these two.
