<h1><a name="browse">Browsing records</a></h1>
The basic functionality of Record Browser is displaying records in a structured and clear way. Together with sorting and filtering it makes a very useful tool. Below, you can see an example of using Record Browser to browse some contacts.
<br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse01.png" />
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Label and basic filter</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse02.png" />
  <br />The title to the left gives information which module or what type of records is displayed. 
  <br />The selection to the right gives the choice from three basic filters: whether you want to display all records, recently used ones or favorite ones.
  To learn more about "Recent" or "Favorites" <a href="#recent_and_favorite">click here</a>.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Filters and search tool</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse03.png" />
  <br />Here you can find two very useful tools that will help you navigate through your records. Filters reduce the amount of displayed records by selecting only these fulfilling chosen criteria and search tool does that by selecting only the records that contain chosen words, phrases, etc.
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">a)</span> "Show filters" button. Click this button to get the filtering options. <a href="#filters">Click here</a> to learn more about filters and using them.
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">b)</span> Simple search. Write the word or phrase that you are looking for and click "Search" button. <a href="#search">Click here</a> to learn more about search options. 
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">c)</span> Advanced search. This tool allows you more complex search, when you want, for example, a certain word in a specific field or a few different word fragments in a few different fields. <a href="#search">Click here</a> to learn more.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Basic tools</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse04.png" />
  <br />The "plus" button to the left serves as the easy way of adding new records. Clicking it will open a filling form.
  <br />The "ABC" button is a tool of a basic alphabetic filter. Clicking it will display a list:
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse05.png" />
  <br />Choose one of the options from this list, for example "C", to display only the records starting with selected letter. The "123" option displays all records starting with numbers and "All" removes the fiter and displays all records.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Basic functionalities</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse06.png" />
  <br />Tools and options gathered in this section will help you manage your records.
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">a)</span> Actions. Here you can view the record in details (click <img src="recordbrowser_action01.png" />), edit it (click <img src="recordbrowser_action02.png" />), view the information about the record (hover mouse over <img src="recordbrowser_action03.png" />) and if it's created or owned by you - remove it (click <img src="recordbrowser_action04.png" />).
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">b)</span> Favorites. The records marked with a coloured star are the ones chosen by you as your favourite. Here you can also change the "favourite" status of the record - click on the <img src="recordbrowser_action05.png" /> to remove the record from your favourites and to make it your favourite - click <img src="recordbrowser_action06.png" />. <a href="#recent_and_favorite">Click here</a> to learn more about favorites.
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">c)</span> Subscriptions. This functionality keeps you up-to-date. A green dot (<img src="recordbrowser_action09.png" />) means that you're subscribing the record (tracking changes) and that you've seen the latest version of it. A red dot (<img src="recordbrowser_action08.png" />) also means that you're subscribing the record, but you haven't seen the latest version of it - you are not up-to-date. Hover mouse over the red dot to see the changes that have been made since you last saw the record. Clicking either red or green dot will unsubscribe the record. A grey dot (<img src="recordbrowser_action07.png" />) means that you're not subscribing the record and clicking it will start the subscription. <a href="#subscriptions">Click here</a> to learn more about subscriptions.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Records</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse07.png" />
  <br />In this section you will find the most important part - the data, the content of the records. It also works as a sorting tool. On the picture below you can see a fragment of an example set of records from Contacts module.
  <br /> On the picture you can see blue labels (with "Last Name" and "First Name" written on them). They inform you what information is in the column below. You can use these labels to sort the records by the value of the column below the label. It's simple - just click the chosen label. Clicking it more than once will switch between ascending and descending order.
  <br />Ascending order is marked with a triangle pointing to the top. It looks like this:
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse08.png" />
  <br />Descending order is marked with a triangle fliped upside down and it looks like this:
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse09.png" />
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Navigation</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_browse10.png" />
  <br />When there are many records, they often must be displayed by pages. On the bottom you will find a tool, that will let you easily navigate through all the pages. 
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">a)</span> Here you can see, which records are displayed at the moment.
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">b)</span> These buttons help you navigate through the pages. On the first page you will see only these two ("Next" and "Last"), but on other pages you will also see "First" and "Prev" buttons (on the picture below), that will let you go back to the previous pages.
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">c)</span> Here you can jump to a specific page. Choose the right number from the select box.
  <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">d)</span> Here you can set the number of records that will be displayed per page - the more records per page, the less pages.
 </li>
</ol>
<!-- -----------------------------------------------RECORD DETAILS--------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1><a name="record">Record details</a></h1>
The exact layout and content of the record details strictly depend on the type of record. Therefore every type of record may look completely different in the detailed view. There are however some interface parts common for all records based on Record Browser and these will be presented in this section, with the record of a company used as an example.
<br /><img src="recordbrowser_details01.png" />
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Module name</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_details02.png" />
  <br />Here you can see what module you are in or what type of record you are seeing.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Actions</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_details03.png" />
  <br />This panel contains many useful and often used tools to help you manage the record. Hover mouse over any of these icons to see a tooltip that will explain what kind of functionality you will get when clicking on it. More detailed description attached below:

   </li>
   <li>
    <img src="recordbrowser_action12.png" />, <img src="recordbrowser_action13.png" />, <img src="recordbrowser_action14.png" /> - these buttons and some other may appear on this action panel depending on the type of the record. These ones create new event, task or phonecall connected with the record. 
   </li>
   <li>
    <img src="recordbrowser_action15.png" /> - new note. Click here to add a new note to the record. To learn more about notes <a href="#notes">click here</a>.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Main area</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_details04.png" />
  <br />Main area is an essential part of this view that contain the data stored by the record. Here you can see the whole information gathered about the particular thing (like company, in this example). The fields with blue background inform about the type of information that is displayed in the fields with white background. The little star symbol * indicates that the field is obligatory to fill.
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Addons</span>
  <br /><img src="recordbrowser_details05.png" />
  <br />This space, located below the main area, is where all kinds of addons can be found. What you will see here depends on the type of the record. For example, for any company you can display here a list of contacts connected with the company (assigned in the system as employees of this company), notes, activities and mails connected with the company and some others. For more detailed description of the addons go to the parts of this manual that cover the specific modules/types of records. To learn more about notes <a href="#notes">click here</a>.

<!-- -----------------------------------------------RECENT AND FAVORITE--------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1><a name="recent_and_favorite">Recent and Favorite records</a></h1>

  </td>
  <td>
   Usually there are many records stored in a system, but not all of them are of interest for the particular user. To help you display only the records you want Record Browser offers a very usefull tool: displaying recent or favorite records only. To choose one of this options, select it from the basic filtering list placed near the title of the module you are currently browsing (on the picture "Companies" module is used as example). There are 3 options available on this list: "All", "Recent" and "Favorites". "All" means that you want to display all possible and available to you records in the category. "Recent" will display records recently seen by you - usually the last 15 you've seen (but this depends on the module). "Favorites" option is used to display only these records that are marked as your favorite. Majority of modules use favorites as a tool, but you may sometimes encounter a module without this functionality, for example, Phone Calls.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<table>
 <tr style="vertical-align:top;">
  <td>
   <img src="recordbrowser_recentandfavorite02.png" />
  </td>
  <td>
   When module uses favorites there is a special column visible (when <a href="#browse">browsing records</a>) that shows whether record is one of favorites or not. This column has the label "Fav". Yellow star icon (<img src="recordbrowser_action05.png" />) means that the record is on the favorite list and will be displayed when the "Favorites" display option is chosen. Clicking on this icon will remove the record from favorites (and the icon near the record will be changed to gray star). Gray star icon (<img src="recordbrowser_action06.png" />) means that the record isn't on the favorites list and won't be displayed in the "Favorites" mode. Clicking this icon will, analogically, make the record one of the favorites (and change it's star icon to yellow one). The same star icon you can see while viewing <a href="#record">record details</a>, in the top right corner, among other actions. You can use it the same way as the ones in <a href="#browse">browsing records</a> mode.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<!-- -----------------------------------------------SUBSCRIPTIONS--------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1><a name="subscriptions">Subscriptions</a></h1>
<table>
 <tr style="vertical-align:top;">
  <td>
   <img src="recordbrowser_subscriptions01.png" />
  </td>
  <td>
   Subscriptions are very important and useful tool implemented in the system. The main idea behind them is to allow users to track changes in records that are important or interesting for them. Subscribing to a record means that from that moment you will be notified of all the changes that are made to that record. For some specific types of records not only changes are tracked, but also the records that use the subscribe record are listed. For example if you subscribe a contact, you will be notified of all the tasks that are assigned for this contact, provided you have an access to them.
<br /> The basic and most convenient way of displaying tracked changes is a dashboard applet specifically designed for subscriptions. <!-- Click here to learn more --> However, you can view them through Record Browser as well. You can see whether the record is subscribed by you or not and you are informed whether you've seen the last changes or not.
<br /> While <a href="#browse">browsing records</a>, the column that covers these aspects is labeled as "Sub" (on the picture). You can see there dots in three different colors. The grey dot (<img src="recordbrowser_action07.png" />) means that you don't subscribe the record, the green one (<img src="recordbrowser_action09.png" />) means that you are subscribing the record and you have seen all the changes, the red one (<img src="recordbrowser_action08.png" />) means that you are subscribing the record and haven't seen recent changes. Hovering the mouse over the red dot will display a tooltip with the changes made since you last viewed the record. Clicking a red or green dot will unsubscribe a record and clicking a gray dot will subcribe a record. To change the status of the record from red to green dot you may view the record (click on it to view its details) or mark the changes as seen in the subscriptions applet.
<br /> You can see a similar dot while veiwing <a href="#record">record details</a>. It is located on actions panel in the top right corner. It can be either green or grey and you can use it to subscribe or unsubscribe the viewed record.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<!-- -----------------------------------------------FILTERS--------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1><a name="filters">Filters</a></h1>
Filters offer you a convenient tool of customizing the way you're browsing records. They allow you to see only the records that meet specified criteria - have certain values in chosen fields.
<br /><img src="recordbrowser_filters01.png" />
<br />Using filters is very simple. While <a href="#browse">browsing records</a> click the "Show filters" button, that is located in the top right corner of the displaying area (as shown on snapshot above). This will display filtering fields which you can use to select the chosen values. The "Hide filters" button will replace "Show filters" button. Click it if you no longer want to see possible filters.
<br /><img src="recordbrowser_filters02.png" />  
<br />The selection of fields by which you can filter depends strictly on the type of displayed records. On the snapshot you can see an example where contacts were used and possible options here are "Company name" and "Group". To filter your records choose values of the options and then click "Show" button.
<!-- -----------------------------------------------SEARCH--------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1><a name="search">Search</a></h1>
There is a search function implemented in Record Browser to help you browse through records even more efficiently and easily. Use it when you are looking for a record or records with specific phrase, word or set of letters (or numbers) in one of its fields.
<br /><img src="recordbrowser_search01.png" />
<br />Searching tools are located in the top-right part of the displaying area (as shown on the snapshot above). Use simple search when you want to search by one keyword/phrase. Write it in the field with "search keyword..." written in it (most to the left) and click "Search" button. The records containing this word or phrase in any field will be displayed.
<br /> If your search needs at the moment are more complex you might want to use advanced search. When you click the "Advanced Search" button, special fields will show up in the main area.
<br /><img src="recordbrowser_search02.png" />
<br />Advanced search will allow you to look for a specific keyword/s in specific field/s. Write the phrases in the fields and click "Search" button to display only the records with chosen values in selected fields. Some of the fields may be unavailable for search (like the last field on the picture).
<br />If you want to go back to simple searching, click "Simple Search" button.
<!-- -----------------------------------------------NOTES--------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1><a name="notes">Notes</a></h1>
To make your information storage more flexible every record has a possibility to attach notes to it. Any kind of information can be linked with the record this way, from loose comments to documents to additional data that doesn't fit in any of the record's fields. Notes are displayed under the main area in <a href="#record">record details</a> among other addons.
<br /><img src="recordbrowser_notes01.png" />
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">New note</span>
