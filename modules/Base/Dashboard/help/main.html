  <td colspan="2">To add a new applet, click on the "Add applet" button located in the ActionBar. Next, choose the type of the applet from the list and, if the chosen applet requires it, set applet's options.

Applets differ from each other in many ways. They have specific options, columns, buttons etc. However, there are a few common interface tools that can be used in any applet. 
<ul><li>"Fullscreen" button - redirects you to the contents of module, whith which the applet is connected. If applet isn't connected with any module, this button won't be shown. 
<br /><img src="dashboard4.png" /><br /></li>
<li>"Toggle" button - swithes between normal and small version of the applet. The small version is limited to only a title bar.
<br /><img src="dashboard5.png" /><br /></li>
<li>"Configure" button - redirects you to the configuration screen, where you can change some of applet's options.
<br /><img src="dashboard6.png" /><br /></li>
<li>"Remove" button - removes the applet from the dashboard. It doesn't remove any data that may be viewed with the applet. However you should remember that with the removal, all options you chose about particular applet are erased.
